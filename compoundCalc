fTimesPerYear = float(input("How many times per year is the interest compounded?: "))
fCompoundingTime = float(input("For how many years will the account earn interest?: "))

# Calculations
nFutureValue = fPrincipalInvestment * (1 + (fInterestRate / 100) / fCompoundingTime ) ** (fCompoundingTime * fTimesPerYear)

# Output and Formating
print(f"At the end of 2 years you will have ${nFutureValue:0,.2f}")
